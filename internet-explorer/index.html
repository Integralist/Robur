            <p>Joseph Lamb does not support versions of the Internet Explorer web browser lower than 8. Below is an outline of why we've made this decision and relevant links to more appropriate, more secure browsers.</p>
            <p>The internet is constantly evolving and moving forward, implementing new and exciting features and technology. As part of this progression to a better web experience, older software needs to be upgraded to both make sure users are protected from known security flaws and to be able to fully enjoy the rich experience modern web applications provide. Our decision to no longer support IE7 and lower is based on its inability to handle basic design features, technological advances or, most importantly, the ability to implement satisfactory security protection and prevention.</p>
            <p>Joseph Lamb therefore recommends the use of other, more up-to-date browsers. Upgrading your browser is free and is very simple. There are many good browsers available. To find out more – or to download them – simply click on the links below:</p>
